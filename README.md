## [deeptesting-junk.pl](deeptesting-junk.pl)

If you tried to use Realme's "deep testing" apk from [here](https://c.realme.com/in/post-details/1591008567903752192)
and got that nasty "This phone model does not support deep testing." screen,
this [script](deeptesting-junk.pl) may help you bypass it.

Run it like this, replacing the `HHH...` with the serial number and the `DDD...`
with IMEIÂ 1 (you can get them both from Settings/About Device/Status):
```
perl deeptesting-junk.pl pcb 0xHHHHHHHH imei DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD cmd applyLkUnlock
```
**Keep the `0x` at the start of the serial number, it's not a typo!**\
Also notice that --despite the `pcb` name-- it really is the serial number, not the
pcb number from the engineermode app! [^1]

If the answer is `{"resultCode":0,"msg":"SUCCESS"}`, continue with
```
perl deeptesting-junk.pl pcb 0xHHHHHHHH imei DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD cmd checkApproveResult
```
If the answer is somethink like
```
{"resultCode":0,"msg":"SUCCESS","data":{"unlockCode":"0345af...lots of hexdigits"}}
```
then try running again the deeptesting app on the phone.

That should now work as described in their tutorials, and the app will reboot the phone
into fastboot/bootloader mode from where you could unlock the bootloader from
your PC with `fastboot flashing unlock`.

Before running the app, you could also try the script with the actual model and
firmware version sent by the app, e.g.:
```
perl deeptesting-junk.pl pcb 0xHHHHHHHH imei DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD cmd checkApproveResult \
       model RMX3474EEA otaVersion RMX3474_XX.L.XX_XXXX_YYYYMMDDHHMM
```

This worked for me, at some point in February 2023, on a Realme 9 5G RMX3474, the
Android 12 GDPR variant of the firmware.

The `deeptesting-junk.pl` script does nothing else than simulate the https requests
performed by the deeptesting app to their `lkf.realmemobile.com` server; it does not
save or send any data anywhere else.

On a debian-like linux system, use `apt-get install libwww-perl libcrypt-rijndael-perl`
to install the modules required by this script.

On windows, the [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/) distribution includes
those modules by default; to prevent the windows console from mangling the output, set
its code page to utf-8 with `chcp 65001` before running the script.

[^1]: The app is getting that value from the [`/proc/oplusVersion/serialID`][serial_id] file.
If you instead try with something that looks like a pcb number, they place your request in
a queue and make you wait forever for an approval which will never come.
